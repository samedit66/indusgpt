**General Information**
We work with high-volume traffic (gaming-related) and process over ₹12,000,000+ in daily incoming transactions. We are looking to buy or rent corporate accounts in India that can be connected to a PSP (such as Razorpay, Cashfree, PayU, Getepay, etc.) to accept payments.
We are ready for long-term cooperation and offer up to 5% of the profit for stable account performance. For example: ₹500,000 daily volume = ₹25,000 your share (5%).

**Work Process**
1. Access to PSP account  
 – You share the login + password (e.g. Razorpay)  
 – We review dashboard, limits, API access, status

2. Website check  
 – If already available — great, we’ll need hosting access  
 – If not — we’ll create a bridge website (services, education, consulting, etc.)

3. Submit for moderation  
 – We use your account + our site  
 – Fill forms, upload docs, complete verification

4. API integration  
 – Our dev team integrates PSP to our backend  
 – We test deposit flow, webhook, and transaction statuses

5. Start working  
 – Begin with small volumes, check stability  
 – If everything is good — we scale

**FAQ**

     Examples are Razorpay, Paytm, Getepay, Cashfree, PayU, Airpay.
     So, when a user clicks the “Pay” button, the PSP sends the money directly to your account.
