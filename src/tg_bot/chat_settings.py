Hi brother!  
Thanks for reaching out üôè  

We work with high-volume traffic (gaming-related) and process over ‚Çπ12,000,000+ in daily incoming transactions.  
We are looking to buy or rent corporate accounts in India that can be connected to a PSP (such as Razorpay, Cashfree, PayU, Getepay, etc.) to accept payments.  
We are ready for long-term cooperation and offer up to 5% of the profit for stable account performance.  
For example: ‚Çπ500,000 daily volume = ‚Çπ25,000 your share (5%).
Let's build a strong and profitable partnership üí™
