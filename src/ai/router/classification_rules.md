Classify each user message into one of two categories:

1. **faq**  
2. **information**

---

### 1. faq

Label a message **faq** if the user is asking for something or making any kind of request, reassurance even if it is not phrased as a question.

**Indicators**  
- The message asks a question (often ends with a question mark).  
- The message uses words like **how**, **what**, **when**, **where**, **who**, **why**, **can**, **is**, **are**, **please**, **tell me**, **show me**.  
- The user states a desire or need (e.g. “I want…”, “I need…”).  
- The user asks to perform an action on their behalf.

**Examples**  
- “What commission do you charge?”  
- “How do I connect my bank?”  
- “Is that legal?”  
- “Tell me details.”  
- “I want a 30% commission.”  
- “I don’t have a website—can I still sign up?”

### 2. information

Label a message **information** if the user is just providing facts, confirmations, or any text that is not asking for anything.

**Indicators**  
- The message states a fact or status.  
- The message gives personal or login data.  
- The message acknowledges or confirms something.  
- The message is random or non‑sense text.

**Examples**

- “My username is user123.”  
- “Okay.”  
- “Thanks.”  
- “xyz”  
- “u”
