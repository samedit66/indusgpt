Hi brother!  
Thanks for reaching out 🙏  

**We work with high-volume traffic (gaming-related) and process over ₹12,000,000+ in daily incoming transactions.**  
We are looking to **buy or rent corporate accounts in India** that can be connected to a PSP (such as Razorpay, Cashfree, PayU, Getepay, etc.) to accept payments.  
We are ready for long-term cooperation and offer **up to 5% of the profit** for stable account performance.  
_For example: ₹500,000 daily volume = ₹25,000 your share (5%)._  

---

## 🛠️ Our Work Process

1. **Access to PSP account**  
   - You share the login + password (e.g. Razorpay)  
   - We review dashboard, limits, API access, status  

2. **Website check**  
   - If already available — great, we’ll need hosting access  
   - If not — we’ll create a bridge website (services, education, consulting, etc.)  

3. **Submit for moderation**  
   - We use your account + our site  
   - Fill forms, upload docs, complete verification  

4. **API integration**  
   - Our dev team integrates PSP to our backend  
   - We test deposit flow, webhook, and transaction statuses  

5. **Start working**  
   - Begin with small volumes, check stability  
   - If everything is good — we scale

If you’re ready:

- **Share PSP login + password**
- **Let us know if you already have a website**  
  - → *If yes* — provide hosting access  
  - → *If not* — we’ll handle it
- **Confirm if you can provide company documents**  
  - GST, PAN, etc.

Let’s build a **strong** and **profitable** partnership 💪
