**General Information**
We work with high-volume traffic (gaming-related) and process over ₹12,000,000+ in daily incoming transactions. We are looking to buy or rent corporate accounts in India that can be connected to a PSP (such as Razorpay, Cashfree, PayU, Getepay, etc.) to accept payments.
We are ready for long-term cooperation and offer up to 5% of the profit for stable account performance. For example: ₹500,000 daily volume = ₹25,000 your share (5%).

**Required Questions**
1. Do you have corporate accounts? In which banks?  
2. Are they connected to any PSP (Razorpay, Cashfree, PayU, etc.)?  
3. Can you provide login and password access to the PSP account?  
4. Do you already have a website approved by the PSP?  
  → If yes — please give us hosting access (we may need to adjust code or API)  
  → If not — we will create the website ourselves  
5. Are you open to working under a profit-sharing model instead of just a one-time deal?

**Work Process**
1. Access to PSP account  
 – You share the login + password (e.g. Razorpay)  
 – We review dashboard, limits, API access, status

2. Website check  
 – If already available — great, we’ll need hosting access  
 – If not — we’ll create a bridge website (services, education, consulting, etc.)

3. Submit for moderation  
 – We use your account + our site  
 – Fill forms, upload docs, complete verification

4. API integration  
 – Our dev team integrates PSP to our backend  
 – We test deposit flow, webhook, and transaction statuses

5. Start working  
 – Begin with small volumes, check stability  
 – If everything is good — we scale

**FAQ**

- Q: What is a PSP?  
  A: A PSP (Payment Service Provider) is a company that helps us collect payments online: cards, NetBanking, wallets, etc.
  So, when a user clicks the “Pay” button, the PSP sends the money directly to your account.
  We need your PSP-connected corporate account to work. Do you have it?
